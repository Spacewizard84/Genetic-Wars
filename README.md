# Genetic-Wars
If there are errors please level a comment because I suspect there to be many of them. The genetic algorithm code I learned from Impractical Python Projects so if the code looks familiar you know why. The rest of the code came from my cranium. You can mod this code use it in diffrent projects. I do encourage you to mod it. Its not to difficult to, just add some functions or if statments or just try and see how bad you can break it. This project is not compelety finshed I will try and fix issues that people leave and just ingenral add more but also I have a game to make. I hope you enjoy this project.
