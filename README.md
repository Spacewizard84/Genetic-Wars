# Genetic-Wars
This a genetic algorithm for python that has a user input and a premade algorithm. Once you input all the data you want for your army let the to battle it out in the wonderful war of evolution who ever reaches the goal first wins. There's also a way to attack the premade algorithm for instance you could nuke them. If there are errors please level a comment because I suspect there to be many of them. The genetic algorithm code I learned from Impractical Python Projects so if the code looks familiar you know why. You can mod this code use it in diffrent projects. I do encourage you to mod it. Its not to difficult to, just add some functions or if statments or just try and see how bad you can break it. This project is not compelety finshed I will try and fix issues that people leave and just ingenral add more but also I have a game to make. I hope you enjoy this project.
