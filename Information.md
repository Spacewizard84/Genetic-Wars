I will now try to explain the basics of Genetic Algorithms for python then again I just learned the basics myself so I am not exactly qualified to do this and I may be wrong in some if not all parts but Ill try anyway. So down to the basics what the program is doing is it's taking all of the given data and using it to evolve. It does this by you guessed it selective breeding until you get the best possible outcome. So it takes the two strongest parents of the first generation and mates them creating a strong baby then that baby goes on to breed again and this continues to happen till we reach our goal. In one of the program files, I'll try to comment on what each function does(notice how I say one that's because the other one is only different with user input and the things that are completely different in the one I don't comment in you'll find comments for.) So that's the basics I think... anyway if I am wrong there's always good old google.
